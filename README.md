# usb-a-magnetic-breakaway

This repo is for documenting and providing the design requirements for an open-source USB-A magnetic breakaway connector. Originally created to be a solution for BusKill cables. I am no longer directly associated with the BusKill project, but welcome the continued use of these files towards those ends. Perhaps you have another reason you want to quickly magnetically detach a USB? Then here's your thing.  This project is a Work In Progress and it welcomes contributors. 

##  What's New?

Updates to goldfishlaser Version:
* Recommend using 4.0 - has latest changes with a new type of pogo receptor
* If continuing to use 3.9 be aware that there are a few issues with it that will need your attention.
* I'm giving a talk at DEF CON! Read about it here: https://crashxblossom.wordpress.com/2024/06/24/defcon32-announcement/ 

## What's in this Repo?
